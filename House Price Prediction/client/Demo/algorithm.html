            <h2>What is Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is a statistical method that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X). The model is constructed by fitting a straight line to the data points, and the coefficients of the line are estimated using a variety of methods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Linear regression is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and it has a wide range of applications in business, science, and engineering.</p>

                <h2>Features and Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trainable on small datasets: Linear regression models can be trained on relatively small datasets, compared to other machine learning algorithms.
                    </li>
                    <li>Versatile: Linear regression models can be used to model a wide variety of relationships between variables, both linear and non-linear.</li>
                    <li>Cost-effectiveness: Linear regression models are relatively inexpensive to train and deploy, making them a cost-effective option for many businesses and organizations.</li>
                    <li>Predictive power: Linear regression models can be used to make accurate predictions about future values of a dependent variable, based on the values of one or more independent variables.</li>

                <h2>How Linear Regression is used to predict house prices-</h2>
                <p>Linear regression is used to predict house prices by establishing a mathematical relationship between various features (independent variables) such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., and the house price (dependent variable). The model learns coefficients for each feature to create a linear equation. When given a new set of features, the model applies these coefficients to make predictions on the house's price based on the input data.</p>
